no, the damage is lasting; you can see it in her eyes but if it was just abused recreation, why did it ruin her life? i mean, if sex is just for fun, why does it take such a toll? maybe it's 'cause you don't just have sex with a body; you have sex with a soul  which means for me, there ain't no premarital lovin' and it ain't just because i don't want a baby in the oven it's because i'm staying pure until the day that i'm a husband but see, this wasn't always me, that's a guarantee let's go back in the past, see who i used to be now, growing up, i never learned how to treat a lady if i learned one thing from my dad, it was \\\"leave the mom, ditch the baby\\\" now, i don't say that to get sympathy; i say that to be real because according to stats, about 40% of you know how that feels so i let the tv show me what the music already told me no dad at home, so i was letting mtv mold me and they sold me, which is why my life revolved around what girl i could get next my life revolved around this girl named \\\"sex\\\" sure, i'd get at her on the text, but i've got to confess it seems the longer we dated, the bigger the mess but then, my girlfriend was late on that time of the month if you know what i mean, you'll understand when i say my heart sunk i started to think about abortion, man; i started to butter it up but it's funny they don't make condoms for sin; you can't just cover it up it was just a scare, but i knew a father i don't wanna be it's funny how i was pro-life until it happened to me so dudes, think twice before you desire her just 'cause she's hot 'cause the truth is, your body makes a promise whether you do or not sorry i digress, though; let's get back to the topic how there's some dudes who pressure her even when she says, \\\"stop it!\\\" you're not a man; you're just a boy that can shave, and you put on a good cover 'cause if you don't respect her when she says no, you certainly don't love her so how about you start studying her heart and stop studying her booty? or maybe invest the same amount of time in her that you do in call of duty 'cause what makes you think you can get this girl and all of a sudden get naughty? 'cause you should have to touch her heart and her mind first before you ever touch her body 'cause she longs to be accepted; she longs to be loved so she gives herself up to another guy's lust she thinks it feels good at first, but then she gets bitter 'cause the promise of satisfaction \\u2014 it never delivers she's like, \\\"i don't want to,\\\" but it's just too tempting so she keeps opening up the present just to find that it's empty and then she starts to get confused she keeps getting rejected by all these dudes they tell her on a scale of ten, she's a two but that ain't true if she only knew that jesus \\u2014 he loves and accepts us even when you don't want him, he'll never reject us he heals us from that sin that totally infects us and he does what condoms can't: he emotionally protect us and i know some of you hearing this are gonna want to indict me but we gotta think rightly, so i'll ask politely can you really say this isn't even true, just slightly? i mean, we touched the forbidden fruit not to realize it's poison ivy and now we're numb and we're itching, and we've got a distorted psyche you don't think; you just do it, like your name was nike not realizing that the consequences of your actions are oh so pricey so this last story, though, is for those who think they're too dirty this last story is for those who think they're unworthy read john chapter eight, the woman caught in adultery the religious leaders throw her naked in the temple while she yells, \\\"don't murder me!\\u201d they say, \\\"jesus, the law commands us to stone this woman\\u201d and you hear the hate in their tone jesus pauses and then says, \\\"whoever is without sin, you can cast the first stone\\u201d i mean, can you imagine the sound? silence all around you hear footsteps walk away, you hear stones hit the ground and then jesus kneels down; the woman thought it was her demise he lifts up her face; you see the grace in his eyes he says, \\\"i don't condemn you; go and sin no more i love you. i accept you. mercy is yours\\\" but if you're anything like me, you're like, \\\"no, that can't be! why would he ever die for me?\\\" see, but then i saw that scene where i was redeemed he reached out and touched me, and said, \\\"jeff, you're free\\\" instantly, i was wearing the brightest robe i'd ever seen i was perfectly spotless; i was perfectly clean so bright, in fact, man, i thought i'd go blind i said, \\\"whose this is?\\\" he said, \\\"actually, it's mine\\u201d so think twice before you eat what society feeds us come follow the king; his name is jesus\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
